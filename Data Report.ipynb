    "# BREAST CANCER DIAGNOSIS & PROGNOSIS USING MACHINE LEARNING\n",
    "# PROJECT REPORT\n",
    "## 1. BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING\n",
    "### 1.1 Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Breast cancer is a major global health concern, and effective care relies on early detection and understanding how aggressive a tumor may be. Manual examination of histopathology images is slow, subjective, and prone to error. Breast cancer also has several molecular subtypes such as Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2-enriched, and Basal-like that influence the rate of tumor growth, treatment response, and patient outcomes.\n",
    "These subtypes are commonly identified using the PAM50 assay, a genomic test that is often costly and not widely accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project addresses these challenges by using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to automatically classify breast tissue images as   malignant(cancerous) or benign(non-cancerous), and by using machine learning to predict molecular subtypes and survival outcomes. It offers a practical, data-driven tool that support diagnosis, treatment decisions, and prognosis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. PROBLEM STATEMENT\n",
    "\n",
    "Breast cancer diagnosis faces these challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Manual examination of tissue images is time consuming, prone to error, and requires specialist expertise.\n",
    "* Molecular subtypes which guide treatment decisions, are usually determined using the PAM50 assay— a costly genomic test that is not widely accessible.\n",
    "* Patients often seek clear information about their prognosis, yet survival predictions rely on multiple clinical and genomic factors that require advanced analytical skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project solves these challenges by building models that classify breast cancer tissue images as benign or malignant, predict molecular subtypes and estimate survival outcomes. The goal is to support earlier detection, data-driven treatment planning, and improved patient outcomes.\n",
