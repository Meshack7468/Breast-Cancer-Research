    "# BREAST CANCER DIAGNOSIS & PROGNOSIS USING MACHINE LEARNING\n",
    "# PROJECT REPORT\n",
    "## 1. BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Breast cancer is a major global health concern, and effective care relies on early detection and understanding how aggressive a tumor may be. Manual examination of histopathology images is slow, subjective, and prone to error. Breast cancer also has several molecular subtypes—such as Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2-enriched, and Basal-like that influence tumor growth, treatment response, and patient outcomes.\n",
    "These subtypes are commonly identified using the PAM50 assay, a genomic test that is often costly and not widely accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project addresses these challenges by using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automatically classify breast tissue images as benign(non-cancerous) or malignant(cancerous), and by using machine learning to predict molecular subtypes and survival outcomes. The system offers a practical, data-driven tool to support diagnosis, treatment decisions, and prognosis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. PROBLEM STATEMENT\n",
    "\n",
    "Breast cancer diagnosis faces two key challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Manual examination of tissue images is time-consuming, error-prone, and requires specialist expertise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Molecular subtypes, which guide treatment, are usually determined through expensive genomic test called the PAM50 assay, which is not widely accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project solves these challenges by building models that classify tissue images as benign or malignant and predict molecular subtypes and survival outcomes. The goal is to enable earlier detection, data-driven treatment planning, and improved patient outcomes.\n",
